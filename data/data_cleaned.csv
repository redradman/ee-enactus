University of British Columbia - Vancouver,https://enactusubc.ca/,Western,"Angele Beausoleil The University of British Columbia Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), Innovation Process Pedagogy and Design Wayne Rawcliffe Walden University Doctor of Education, Higher Education and Adult Learning",Jack Bremner Urvee Mulye,entrepreneurship@UBC (e@UBC) Managing Director: Paul Cubbon (faculty champion) and professional staff team,"B.Comm Entrepreneurship Option: UBC Sauder offers a set of entrepreneurship and innovation courses. Students take foundational courses in venture creation and innovation (e.g. COMM 466 – New Venture Design, a 6-credit capstone where business and engineering students build a startup together) and choose from electives like Innovation and Sustainability, Impact Investing, Green Entrepreneurship, Social Entrepreneurship, and Venture Capital Note: The option is interdisciplinary (even Science and Arts students can take entrepreneurship minors or courses). UBC also runs cross-faculty programs such as “New Venture Design” (jointly by Business & Engineering) and “Lab2Market” for research-based ventures. Undergraduate Courses COMM 485 – Social Entrepreneurship: This course provides an overview of social enterprise, exploring business structures and funding methods used by social entrepreneurs. Students engage in hands-on experience with real social ventures, learning to generate business plans for social enterprises. COMM 386L – Impact Investing: Social Finance in the 21st Century Focuses on the growing field of impact investing, teaching students how to assess and manage investments that generate social and environmental impact alongside financial returns. COMM 386M – Green Entrepreneurship and Sustainable Startups Explores the creation and management of environmentally sustainable businesses, emphasizing innovation in green technologies and sustainable business models. Entrepreneurship@UBC (e@UBC): Entrepreneurship@UBC is an initiative that supports UBC students, faculty, and staff in developing entrepreneurial ventures. It offers: Training Programs: Workshops and courses on ideation, business model creation, and company building. Mentorship: Access to a network of experienced entrepreneurs and industry experts. Funding Opportunities: Support for early-stage ventures through seed funding and investor connections.","Very experiential and interdisciplinary. UBC emphasizes learning by doing: in New Venture Design, student teams from diverse backgrounds develop prototypes and business models over two terms (graded on venture milestones and a final investor pitch). Other courses use case studies (including failures), simulation games, and consulting projects with startups. Many classes feature venture pitches to judges for evaluation. UBC encourages reflective learning on entrepreneurial mindset as well. Assessment ranges from feasibility studies and pitch decks to innovation audits and exams on entrepreneurship theory. Overall, the pedagogy balances theory (e.g. economics of innovation) with practice (team-based startup projects).","entrepreneurship@UBC (e@UBC) Incubator: A campus-wide venture accelerator that has supported 650+ UBC venture teams (students, alumni, faculty)​. It offers programs for varying stages: Venture Founder for new ideas, HATCH Venture Builder for later-stage startups, and specialized streams. UBC also has other co-curriculars: e@UBC’s annual Venture Showcase (highlighting top startups to investors), hackathons and startup weekends on campus, and the Creative Destruction Lab (CDL-Vancouver) which students may intern with.","2025 Nationals: Top 4 Nationally 2025 Regionals: TD Entrepreneurship Regional Champions, Innovation and Impact Regional Champions, Desjardins Youth Empowerment Regional Champions 2024 Desjardins Youth Empowerment Regional and National Champion 2023: Scotiabank Climate Action and TD Entrepreneurship Regional Champion","Best Practices: UBC excels in a comprehensive approach – academic programs feed into incubators (students from courses often continue into e@UBC programs), creating a full pipeline from idea to launch. The combination of curricular, co-curricular (Enactus), and extra-curricular (e@UBC, CDL) resources is a model ecosystem. Gaps: With such a large ecosystem, coordination can be challenging – UBC could improve connecting undergraduate entrepreneurs with later-stage venture opportunities (though e@UBC is working to bridge this). Enactus UBC, while successful in specific projects, could grow in scale relative to UBC’s size (leveraging more of the huge student population). Overall, UBC’s challenge is managing its breadth, but its successes speak to a thriving entrepreneurial culture."
Capilano University,https://enactuscapilano.ca/,Western,"Trevor McFayden University of Leicester PhD (Candidate), Management",Apollonia Giebel,School of Business,"BBA with Entrepreneurship focus: Capilano’s business degrees incorporate entrepreneurship via electives and a unique applied course. BADM 332 – Managing Not-for-Profit Organizations & Social Enterprises: This course provides an understanding of the social economy, exploring management challenges and opportunities in integrating business functions with social goals. It includes a service-learning project with a non-profit organization. BADM 469 – Applied Understanding of Indigenous Entrepreneurship Focuses on Indigenous entrepreneurship, examining how economic reconciliation is pursued through ventures that align with community values and traditions. Community Leadership and Social Change Diploma A two-year diploma program emphasizing community development, leadership, and social change, with courses in digital tools for social change and service learning. BADM 380 “Community Empowerment through Enactus” – a 3-credit course where student teams design and execute community entrepreneurship projects (in partnership with local organizations). This work-integrated learning course is open to all business students (Enactus membership not required to enrol)","Highly experiential and community-engaged. In BADM 380, students are assessed on the planning and impact of their Enactus projects – real deliverables for community partners and presentations of results",Only notable co-curricular activity is Enactus as there is a course to support the club as well,N/A,"Best Practices: Integration of co-curricular Enactus work into an academic course for credit is a standout model​ - it formally bridges classroom learning with community impact. This approach enhances student commitment and provides academic recognition for experiential learning. Gaps: Being a smaller institution, CapU has limited funding and reach for entrepreneurship – scaling up projects beyond campus or sustaining them long-term can be challenging. There is also currently no standalone entrepreneurship major (students gain exposure mainly through electives and Enactus), which could be an area for growth."
NAIT,https://www.ookslife.ca/organization/enactus-nait,Western,Kevin Mcghan University of Alberta MBA,Not publicly listen,Mawji Centre (Entrepreneurship Hub) Manager: Amanda Sigaty​ Lead Entrepreneur-in-Residence: Dale Schaub,"ENTR101 – Entrepreneurship and Business Start-Up: A 60-hour online course that guides students through the process of developing a viable start-up, including business planning and cultivating an entrepreneurial mindset.","Very practical and industry-aligned. Many courses use case studies of startups and require students to create business models or prototypes. Assessment methods include developing business plans, pitching to instructors or external judges, and co-op work terms. NAIT leverages its polytechnic approach: courses frequently involve lab-style applied projects and evaluation on tangible outcomes (sales generated in a student-run venture, effectiveness of a marketing plan, etc.). Entrepreneurship & Innovation students engage in capstone projects that may be judged by industry panels, simulating investment pitches.","Mawji Centre for New Venture & Student Entrepreneurship: NAIT’s on-campus entrepreneurship hub that inspires an entrepreneurial mindset through mentorship, events and competitions​. It runs programs like “Pitch It To Me” (pitch competition), Innovation Challenge, and the Blue Book Program (a free venture-launch bootcamp)",2025 Innovation and Impact Regional Champion,"Best Practices: Strong institutional commitment through the Mawji Centre – offering free resources, mentors, and events for all students helps cultivate entrepreneurship beyond the classroom​. The BBA program’s close alignment with industry ensures graduates have practical skills. Gaps: As a teaching-focused polytechnic, applied projects are strong, but research or large-scale startup acceleration is limited – NAIT could expand partnerships (with incubators or investors) to help graduate entrepreneurs scale up their ventures beyond college. Additionally, Enactus NAIT, while active, has room to grow its profile nationally."
Wilfred Laurier,https://www.enactuslaurier.ca/,Central,Laura Allen York University MBA,Jordan Prentice,Schlegel Centre for Entrepreneurship Exec. Director: Laura Allan,"BBA Entrepreneurship Concentration: offers courses on new venture creation, entrepreneurial finance, social entrepreneurship, etc. For example, “Business Model Creation” course teaches lean startup methodology so students can achieve problem-solution fit and launch ventures with minimized risk Laurier also introduced a Social Entrepreneurship Minor in the Faculty of Arts (first of its kind in Canada)","Highly experiential and project-based. Flagship incubator course (LaunchPad, via ENTR300/301) requires application/interview and coaches students through launching a startup idea","Laurier LaunchPad Incubator: run by the Schlegel Centre, supports students and alumni in bringing ideas to market with coaching and mentorship​ Student Venture Fund: Laurier Startup Fund (launched with $1M donor gift) lets students evaluate and invest in real startups as part of their training Campus Competitions: Annual pitch competitions and case competitions are encouraged (Laurier hosts an internal entrepreneurship competition and participates in external ones).","2025 Nationals: Desjardins Youth Empowerment Challenge National Champion, 2nd place Nationally 2025 Regionals: Desjardins Youth Empowerment Regional Champion, TD Entrepreneurship Regional Champion, Innovation and Impact Regional Champion 2024 Regionals: TD Entrepreneurship Regional Champion, Canadian Tire Sustainability Regional Champion 2024 Nationals: 2nd place Nationally 2023 National Champion 2020 & 2021: National Champion","Best Practices: Strong integration of curricular and co-curricular – academic courses feed into the LaunchPad incubator, and a donor-funded student venture capital fund gives real investment experience​. Entrepreneurship opportunities exist for non-business students (Arts minor) promoting inclusivity Gaps: Could broaden faculty mentorship for Enactus and startup teams as program grows; ensuring resources for social ventures outside the business school remains an ongoing challenge."
Lambton College,https://www.enactuslambton.org/,Central,"Matt Abercrombie University of Fredericton MBA, Global Leadership",Amandeep Kalsi,Entrepreneurship Faculty Contact: Business Dept. Chair,"Business Administration – Entrepreneurship & Small Business (Diploma): 2–3 year program focusing on venture planning, small business management, and social enterprise. Coursework covers opportunity identification, business plan writing, small business finance, and marketing. CSCP-1983 – Social Entrepreneurship: A course designed to introduce students to the principles and practices of social entrepreneurship. ENT-1303 – Entrepreneurship: This course covers the fundamentals of starting and managing a business, emphasizing entrepreneurial thinking. BUSF-1640 – Start Your Own Small Business: Focuses on the practical aspects of launching a small business, including planning and operations.","Applied learning with extensive real-world projects. Students often work in teams to implement actual business solutions. Assessment is heavily project-based – creating business plans, prototypes, and running small ventures or simulations. Lambton leverages Enactus participation as a learning vehicle: many entrepreneurship students join Enactus projects to apply classroom knowledge in the field. The teaching approach emphasizes social entrepreneurship and global impact, reflecting college values.","Incubation & Competitions: The college supports Enactus projects as informal incubators – students get mentorship and often travel for international project implementation. Lambton’s Enactus team competes and excels in Enactus Canada competitions. Beyond Enactus, Lambton hosts entrepreneurship events like pitch competitions and supports student startups through campus Launch Pad program and faculty mentorship.",2024: TD Entrepreneurship Regional Champion 2022: Scotiabank Climate Action Challenge Regional Champion,"Best Practices: Good use of social entrepreneurship projects to provide students experiential learning – Lambton’s model of linking curriculum to an award-winning Enactus project (One Seed) is a case study in high-impact teaching. Strong institutional support (travel, resources) enables students to tackle global challenges. Gaps: Academic offerings beyond the diploma level are limited (no entrepreneurship degree program); post-graduation continuity of projects can be challenging, requiring transition plans to local partners to sustain impacts."
St. Mary’s University,https://arthurlirvingentrepreneurshipcentre.ca/for-students/enactus-saint-marys/,Eastern,Michael Sanderson Saint Mary's University MBA,Gabe Martin,Entrepreneurship Centre (SMUEC) - dedicated staff (Director & team),"B.Comm/B.A. Major in Entrepreneurship: curriculum emphasizes innovation, design thinking and lean start-up approaches​.

Competitions – Students compete in pitch competitions and national Enactus events (SMU hosts internal New Product Competition with $10k prizes​ Incubator Support – SMUEC provides mentoring, a Runway kiosk for student start-ups to test products in-market and and cross-campus “ENbassador” outreach programs engaging students university-wide","2025 Regionals: 1st place- Canadian Tire Environmental Sustainability Challenge, Innovation and Impact Challenge, and TD Entrepreneurship Challenge 2025 Nationals: Innovation and Impact National Champion, National Champion advancing to the World Cup 2024: National Champion 2023: Scotiabank Climate Action Challenge Regional Champion 2022: CWB Financial Education Challenge Regional Champion",Best Practices: Cross-faculty integration of entrepreneurship (SMUEC works across all faculties) and student ambassador programs to embed entrepreneurial mindset broadly​. Strong Enactus performance demonstrates real-world impact. Gaps: Limited public data on long-term startup survival; could further expand mentorship capacity as interest grows campus-wide.
Nova Scotia Community College - Ivany,https://subjectguides.nscc.ca/sdg/entrepreneurship#s-lg-box-16550624,Eastern,Not publicly listed,Not publicly listed,NSCC Entrepreneurship Office: central entrepreneurship support team (coordinates student entrepreneurship across 14 campuses),"NSCC offers Business Administration diploma programs wherein students can choose entrepreneurship-related courses or projects. Rather than a single college-wide curriculum for entrepreneurship, NSCC embeds entrepreneurial skill-building opportunities in many programs (e.g. project-based courses in business, applied research projects in communities). Additionally, NSCC runs an extra-curricular Entrepreneur-in-the-Making funding program for student entrepreneurs​","Many students learn entrepreneurship through project work integrated in their courses – for example, solving real social problems for course credit (NSCC has a Challenge Nova Scotia competition where students create solutions to provincial issues in a 90-second pitch video​. Assessment often involves team projects addressing a local need, reflecting NSCC’s applied learning model. Given NSCC programs are typically 2-year diplomas, the focus is on rapid skill development – students might be graded on a capstone business plan or a community project implemented within a term.","Challenge Nova Scotia (province-wide student innovation challenge) and workshops through its Entrepreneurship office. Mentorship is provided by faculty and industry volunteers to Enactus and non-Enactus student entrepreneurs. Enactus at NSCC: NSCC has Enactus teams across multiple campuses – including Ivany (Halifax), Pictou, Strait Area, Sydney Waterfront, Truro, and even an eCampus team",N/A,"Best Practices: NSCC’s multi-campus Enactus model shows how to engage a broad, distributed student population in entrepreneurial action – a strong example of community college students driving social change. The integration of entrepreneurship into various disciplines (not just business) via challenges and projects aligns with NSCC’s mandate of community impact. Gaps: Short program durations mean sustaining projects is difficult – knowledge transfer year-to-year is critical. Additionally, being spread across campuses can dilute resources; a more unified strategy or additional funding could amplify the scale of each project. Nonetheless, NSCC has leveraged partnerships (e.g. Jeanne Sauvé Foundation) to extend its impact globally, an impressive feat for a community college."
